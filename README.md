# Google Web App for an Inspection Company 

> Resources:
- App Script 
- Google spreadsheets

> Background
- A contractor sought a way to present inspection details from their internal spreadsheet database without providing direct access. Using App Scripts, I was able to develop a web app that allowed them to interact with their data in a dedicated, user-friendly environment.
